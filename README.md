# MLAlgoViz

MLAlgoViz is an interactive educational platform I developed to demystify complex machine learning and deep learning concepts through dynamic visualizations. The project features intuitive, interactive demonstrations of key ML principles including function approximation with neural networks, variational autoencoders, optimization challenges like saddle points, the effects of different optimizers (SGD vs. Adam/AdamW), and the architecture of various encoder-decoder models.

This visualization toolkit serves as both a personal learning tool and a resource for students and professionals in the field. By making abstract concepts concrete and manipulable, MLAlgoViz bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. The platform continues to grow with new visualizations that address challenging ML concepts, optimization techniques, and architectural paradigms, providing an evolving resource for the machine learning community.
